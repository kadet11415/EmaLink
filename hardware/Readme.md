### PCB Assembly

You will have to look at the schematic and the board design in Kicad to know where the parts go, and how they are oriented.

I use a hot-air rework station to solder the BLE113 module, the CC1110 chip, the USB connector, the 24Mhz crystal and the 3 power coils. The rest can be soldered with normal soldering station but require good soldering skills (especially the balun and the RF tuning network)
