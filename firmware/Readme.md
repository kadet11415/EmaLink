# Loading Firmware

There are two microprocessors on the EmaLink board; a ble113 module, and a cc1110. Each needs it's own firmware.

## CC1110 Firmware

For the cc1110, you should install the firmware [emalink_rfspy](https://github.com/sks01/EmaLink/blob/master/firmware/cc1110/).

You can then use the following tools to write the firmware:
